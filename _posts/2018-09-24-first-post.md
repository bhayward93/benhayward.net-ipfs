## This Blog

This blog has been hosted on IPFS, soon I will be adding a tutorial so that you can see how you too can create a decentralized Jekyll/IPFS blog site, and host it for free for pennies a month. 

## Who am I
I'm a Developer & architect based in the north-east of England, with a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science. Decentralized systems are currently my primary focus, I am absolutely fascinated currently with IPFS and DLT technology (HyperLedger!). I try to keep on the bleeding edge where possible, because it's pretty damn fun here.

## What will I be posting about
* General Programming Ramblings.
* Blockchain.
* General Decentralized tech.
* DLT / NoDB Solutions.
* Maybe the occasional funny.
